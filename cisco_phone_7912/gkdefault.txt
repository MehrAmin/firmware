# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file "gkdefault.txt" is provided as a convenience for upgrading the
# Cisco 7912G IP Phone with minimal effort.  
#
# If changes are made to this file, you must run 
#
#         cfgfmt -tsip_ptag.dat gkdefault.txt gkdefault.cfg
#
# again to create a new profile and place it in the TFTP directory.
#
# If you plan to upgrade just one phone, you can copy gkdefault.cfg to
# gk<MAC>, where <MAC> is the MAC address of the target phone, such
# as gk001122334455.
#
# The phone will try to download gk<mac> first, then gkdefault.cfg
# if corresponding gk<MAC> is not found on the TFTP server.
